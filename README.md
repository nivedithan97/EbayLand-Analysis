# EbayLand-Analysis
As a new seller on Ebayland, there are two types of restrictions:
1) item limit: it is a limit on the number of items I can sell per month (i.e. 30 items in this case)
2) price limit: it is the limit on the total price of items I can sell per month (i.e. 1000 AUD per month in this case).

In this project, with these given restrictions, I want to select the products such that the total profit in a month is maximised. This project will be split into two tasks.

TASK 1: Maximise profit when there is no item limit.
Assuming I have contacted Ebayland and convinced them to waive the item limit for the first month. In other words, for the first month, I am allowed to sell as many items as I want as long as the total price of the sold items is less than or equal to the price limit. 

TASK 2: Maximise profit with both item limit and price limit.
In this task, I will be finding a strategy to maximise profit given both the item limit and price limit. 

For this project, I will be implementing a Dynamic programming strategy.
